Scenario: add director to existing movie
  When I go to the edit page for "The Help"
  And  I fill in "Director" with "David"
  And  I press "Update Movie Info"
  Then the director of "The Help" should be "David"

Scenario: find movie with same director
  Given I am on the details page for "The Help"
  When  I follow "Find Movies With Same Director"
  And   I should not see "Chicken Run"

Scenario: can't find similar movies if we don't know director (sad path)
  Given I am on the details page for "Aladdin"
  Then  I should not see "David"
  When  I follow "Find Movies With Same Director"
  Then  I should be on the home page
